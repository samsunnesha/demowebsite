                as they are key variable of measure of development as they indicate quality of life, awareness level and also level
                of skill of people in the society. Better literacy and educational level definitely have a positive impact on the health
                parameters. Education parameters have an equal weightage in the Human Development Index as well. Condering
                the importance of education, India has enacted Right to Education to ensure free and compulsory Education for
                children in the age group 6- 14 years. 9 new tables have been included from NSS 71st Round report.The difference i

            <p class="text-small sectionSubTag">Financial literacy is the confluence of financial, credit, and debt management and the knowledge that is necessary to make financially responsible decisions—decisions that are integral to our everyday lives. Financial literacy includes understanding how a checking account works, what using a credit card really means, and how to avoid debt. In sum, financial literacy impacts the daily issues an average family makes when trying to balance a budget, buy a home, fund the children’s education, and ensure an income at retirement.

                A lack of financial literacy is a problem not only in emerging or developing economies. Consumers in developed or advanced economies also fail to demonstrate a strong grasp of financial principles in order to understand and negotiate the financial landscape, manage financial risks effectively, and avoid financial pitfalls. Nations globally, from Korea to Australia to Germany, are faced with populations that do not understand financial basics.
